# Description

üîê Advanced Security Features

Secret Code Entry System: Our smart home is secured with a keypad entry system. If the code is entered incorrectly three times, a buzzer is triggered, alerting everyone to a potential security breach.
ESP Camera Surveillance: The house is monitored 24/7 using an ESP cam, providing real-time surveillance to deter and detect any unauthorized access.

üåßÔ∏è Comprehensive Environmental Monitoring

Rain Sensor: This sensor monitors the outdoor environment, detecting rain to help automate windows or cover controls, keeping the house protected during storms.
Temperature and Flame Sensors: We've integrated sensors to detect temperature changes and potential fire hazards, ensuring prompt alerts in case of emergencies.

üí° Intelligent Lighting Solutions

LDR Light Sensor: The lighting in the house‚Äôs corridors is automated based on ambient light levels, ensuring that lights come on when it‚Äôs dark and turn off when not needed.
PIR Motion Detection: Inside the house, a PIR motion sensor automatically turns on lights when someone enters a room and turns them off when they leave, providing energy efficiency and convenience.
LED Indicators: These LEDs provide visual feedback for various system statuses, including power, security alerts, and sensor activations.
